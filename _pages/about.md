I'm a computer scientist interested in computational optics and machine learning based image reconstruction and segmentation for microscopy. 
Currently I am a ELISIR scholar/group leader at EPFL, Switzerland.

For my research, have a look at my [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZltxyqoAAAAJ&hl) or [my lab page](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/weigert-lab/).
